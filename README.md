# SCRP

SCRP is a data blog about my job search. We'll be gathering info from job boards, which we'll sort, transform, and try to gain insights from. Everything we learn will be available through an interactive site, where users can learn, interact, and provide feedback. 

We're starting with Craigslist, because the HTML is relatively simple. Ideally we'll hit Indeed, Monster, and GitHub, and more.

##### Tools

I'm working with Python 3.8, MySQL 8.0, and Flask 1.1 for the web backend. I haven't picked my JavaScript libraries yet, but there will be js visualization involved.

Come back soon! Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CalTissue) if you want to get involved somehow.

##### Missing folders

If you check out the core app functions you'll notice there are log files & folders missing from the repo. I don't want to include the actual data in the repo, because a) they're log files, and b) it's all going into a MySql db to live permanently. If you want to clone the repo, add the folders and you'll be all good.
