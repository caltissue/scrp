# SCRP

SCRP is a data blog about my job search. We'll be gathering info from job boards, which we'll sort, transform, and try to gain insights from. Everything we learn will be available through an interactive site, where users can learn, interact, and provide feedback. 

##### Tools

I'm working with Python 3.8, MySQL 8.0, and Flask 1.1 for the web backend. I haven't picked my JavaScript libraries yet, but there will be js visualization involved.

Come back soon! Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CalTissue) if you want to get involved somehow.
